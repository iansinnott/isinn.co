# isinn.co

Where Ian Sinnott builds cool stuff.

## So, what is this?

This is the source code for [isinn.co][isinn], where I host a number of my personal projects. I simply grabbed the URL because it was fairly short and I wanted some place to host my own mini-Heroku.

This site, along with most of the projects listed there are run on [Dokku][dokku].
